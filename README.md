STAT 445 Theoretical Statistics I

## Required Textbook

[Statistical Inference (Second Edition), by George Casella and Roger L. Berger.](https://github.com/Thomson-Cui/Theoretical-Statistics-I/blob/main/Book/textbook.pdf)

## Course Topics
The objective of this course is to introduce to students the basic theory of probability and probability
distributions, which is fundamentally important for understanding commonly used statistical concepts and
methods. This course also provides students a necessary basis for a further study of advanced statistical
courses. We plan to cover the following topics from the textbook.

### Probability Theory
- Set Theory, Basics of Probability Theory, Conditional Probability and Independence, Random
Variables, Distribution Functions, Density and Mass Functions
### Transformations and Expectation
- Distributions of Functions of a Random Variable, Expected Values, Moments and Moment
Generating Functions
### Common Families of Distributions
- Discrete Distributions, Continuous Distributions, Exponential Families, Location and Scale
Families, Inequalities and Identities
### Multiple Random Variables
- Joint and Marginal Distributions, Conditional Distributions and Independence, Bivariate Trans-
formations, Hierarchical Models and Mixture Distributions, Covariance and Correlation, Multi-variate Distributions
### Properties of Random Samples
- Sums of Random Variables, Distributions derived from the Normal Distribution, Order Statistics
